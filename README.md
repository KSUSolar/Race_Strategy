We're going to have to implement a GPS system in the car (which we'll deal with later) and a receiver to pull information from the ground team. This requires splitting the track into sections and finding the optimal speed given,
-Battery Percentage    -Weather
-Solar Array Output    -Track Inclination
-Track Topography    -Probably some other stuff I forgot

Make a map of the track.
It's the heartland motor sports speedway in Topeka Kansas.
Split the track into sections using GPS coordinates where speed would need to be changed
(Ex. straight aways, sharp turns, significant changes in elevation)
Assign a speed value to each of the sections and make it variable.
